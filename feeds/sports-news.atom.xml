&lt;p&gt;The dust has settled, the confetti has been swept away, and the echoes of cheering fans still resonate from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Super Bowl LX, played on February 8, 2026, delivered a spectacular culmination to the NFL season, witnessing a dominant performance from the Seattle Seahawks against the New England Patriots. It was a night of unforgettable plays, a groundbreaking halftime show, and commercials that captivated millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Seattle Seahawks secured their second Super Bowl title in franchise history, defeating the New England Patriots with a decisive 29-13 victory. The game was a testament to Seattle's relentless defense, which stifled the Patriots' offense throughout the night, holding them scoreless for the first three quarters. Quarterback Drake Maye faced immense pressure, enduring six sacks as the Seahawks' defensive line dictated the tempo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the defense shone brightly, the Seahawks' offense found its rhythm, with kicker Jason Myers contributing a significant 17 points, including five field goals, setting a new Super Bowl record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kenneth-walker-iii-super-bowl-lx-mvp"&gt;Kenneth Walker III: Super Bowl LX MVP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual highlight of the game undoubtedly belonged to Seattle Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III, who was crowned Super Bowl LX MVP. Walker delivered a powerful rushing performance, accumulating 135 yards on 27 carries and adding 26 receiving yards, totaling an impressive 161 scrimmage yards. His ability to control the clock and consistently gain yardage was crucial in wearing down the Patriots' defense and setting the tone for Seattle's victory. Notably, Walker became the first running back to win the Super Bowl MVP award since Terrell Davis in Super Bowl XXXII in 1998, marking a significant and rare achievement in a pass-heavy era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the gridiron action, the Super Bowl LX Halftime Show was a cultural phenomenon. Headlined by Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, the performance marked a historic first as a Latino solo artist took center stage. He delivered a vibrant, energetic set performed almost entirely in Spanish, celebrating Latin culture with guest appearances from Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite some initial criticism and debate, the performance garnered immense viewership, becoming the fourth-most-watched halftime show in history. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) later concluded that the performance adhered to broadcast standards, finding no violations after a review. Bad Bunny's show was a bold statement, emphasizing unity and the joy of coming together through music and visual storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="commercials-that-captivated"&gt;Commercials That Captivated&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, Super Bowl LX wasn't just about football and music; it was a showcase for some of the year's most anticipated commercials. Brands pulled out all the stops, delivering a mix of humor, nostalgia, and star power. Memorable ads included Instacart's retro-themed spot with Ben Stiller, Hellmann's featuring Andy Samberg as "Meal Diamond," and Dunkin's "Good Will Dunkin'" which brought together an ensemble of 80s and 90s sitcom icons alongside Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, and Tom Brady. Budweiser's "American Icons" also resonated, leveraging beloved mascots and evocative storytelling. These commercials once again proved that the Super Bowl remains a premier platform for advertising innovation and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-super-bowl-for-the-ages"&gt;A Super Bowl for the Ages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super Bowl LX will be remembered not just for the Seattle Seahawks' well-deserved championship and Kenneth Walker III's MVP-winning heroics, but also for its cultural impact.
